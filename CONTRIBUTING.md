# Contribution Guidelines

This resource is a community effort and wouldn't be possible without you! We appreciate and recognize [all contributors](https://github.com/swill/awesome-gc/graphs/contributors).

- **To add, remove, or change items on the list:** `Submit a pull request`
- Changes to the content should be made in the `README.md` file. 

Please follow the following guidelines when contributing:

- List items should be sorted *alphabetically*.
- Each item should be limited to one project.
- The link should be the name of the package, project or policy.
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.
- An item should only be present in one category.
- At least 3 items are needed to create a new category.

Please contribute links to packages/projects/policies you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality Standards

To be on the list, project repositories should adhere to these quality standards:

- If a package/library, the code functions as documented and expected
- Generally useful to the wider community of Government of Canada employees
- Actively maintained
  - Regular, recent activity
  - Or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to
- Stable or progressing toward stable
- Thoroughly documented so a newcomer can understand what they are looking at
- Tests, where practical. If the program/package/library is testable, then coverage should be >= 80% for non-data-related packages and >=90% for data related packages.


## Maintainers

To make sure every PR is checked, we have a [team of maintainers](MAINTAINERS). Every PR MUST be reviewed by at least two maintainers before it can get merged. *This rule will come into effect once there are at least two maintainers.* **Note: Please consider becoming a maintainer.**  

The maintainers will review your PR and notify you and tag it in case any
information is still missing. They will wait 8 days for your interaction, after
that the PR will be closed.


## Reporting Issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes packages/projects fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!  Looking forward to your contribution.
